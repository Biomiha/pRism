Description: This package provides functions to read and parse GraphPad Prism files (.pzfx or .prism) into R data frames, enabling users to analyse and manipulate their data within the R environment.
    It currently consists of two functions - `get_table_names` and `read_prism`, both of which take the file path to a prism file as input and output either the table names or the table contents themselves.
